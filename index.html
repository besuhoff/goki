    <article><p>In this game called Goki you need to guess an ordered combination of 4 colored chips. The possible colors are
        blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Place an assumed combination of chips by clicking holes in a larger box of
        an available row. Choose chip color by iterating through 5 available colors - left mouse button goes forward
        while right mouse click goes backwards.</p>
    <p>Once ready with the assumption, hit "Respond!" button. I will respond with placing few black and white chips into
        a smaller hole in response. Each black chip means one of your chips' position and color matches exactly the
        color and the position of a chip in my combination. Each white chip means that you guessed the color of one of
        my chips but placed it in a different position. Empty holes mean that all the rest of the chips in my
        combination don't match the color of any of yours.</p>
    <p>Think carefully! If you fill up the whole board before guessing the combination, you lose.</p></article>
