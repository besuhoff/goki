            In this game called Goki you need to guess an ordered combination of 4 coloured chips. The possible colours
            are blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. There might be multiple chips of the same color in a combination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place an assumed combination of chips by clicking holes in a larger box of an available row. Choose chip
            colour by iterating through 5 available colours - left mouse button goes forward while right mouse click
            goes backwards.
        </p>
        <p>Once ready with the assumption, hit "Respond!" button. I will respond with placing an unordered set of black
            and white chips into a smaller box. Each black chip means one of your coloured chips' position and colour
            matches exactly the colour and the position of a chip in my combination. Each white chip means that you
            guessed the colour of one of my chips but placed it in a different position. Empty holes mean that all the
            rest of the chips in my combination don't match the colour of any of yours.
        </p>
        <p>Think carefully! If you fill up the whole board before guessing the combination, you lose.</p>
