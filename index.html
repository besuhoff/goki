    <article><p>In this game called Goki you need to guess an ordered combination of 4 coloured chips. The possible
        colours are blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Place an assumed combination of chips by clicking holes in a
        larger box of an available row. Choose chip colour by iterating through 5 available colours - left mouse button
        goes forward while right mouse click goes backwards.</p>
    <p>Once ready with the assumption, hit "Respond!" button. I will respond with placing an unordered set of black and
        white chips into a smaller box. Each black chip means one of your coloured chips' position and colour matches
        exactly the colour and the position of a chip in my combination. Each white chip means that you guessed the
        colour of one of my chips but placed it in a different position. Empty holes mean that all the rest of the chips
        in my combination don't match the colour of any of yours.</p>
    <p>Think carefully! If you fill up the whole board before guessing the combination, you lose.</p></article>
